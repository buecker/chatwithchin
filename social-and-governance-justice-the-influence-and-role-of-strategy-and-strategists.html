Let's start by realizing she was an icon for us all. Her unmistakable talent for building consensus using her intellect, skills, and voice has left a lasting imprint on our society. Whether you choose to remember her as the "Notorious RBG" or "You can spell Truth without Ruth," one thing is for sure, she was a strategist. <a href="https://www.strategyassociation.org/?ref=chatwithchin.com">Strategy</a> resembles leadership. It is not a title, but a way of thinking to bring about bold action leading to transformation. With each step of her journey, she enacted change, developed those around her, and endeavored for liberty, equality, and progress. Now, what's next? As Ruth demonstrated perseverance and determination, let's do the same. Let's use our intellect. Let's use our skills. Let's use our voice. As strategists, let's bring bold action for change in our families, community, and organizations.</p><p>Original post: <a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.strategyassociation.org/resource/resmgr/strategic_edge_newsletter_december_2015/2020/Updated__-_Social_and_Govern.pdf?ref=chatwithchin.com">Association for Strategic Planning - Strategic Edge October 2020</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 2, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://chatwithchin.com/authors/dr-chinue-uecker/" rel="author">Dr. Chinue Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://chatwithchin.com/steps-toward-operational-excellence.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Steps Toward Operational Excellence</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
