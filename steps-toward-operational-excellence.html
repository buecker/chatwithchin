It not only enables each employee, regardless of function, to see and understand various patient pathways within the healthcare setting; it also empowers employees to resolve problems when they arise. There are many tools and techniques that can be used to help organizations along their journey to Operational Excellence.  The <a href="https://asq.org/quality-resources/lean/value-stream-mapping?ref=chatwithchin.com">Value Stream Map</a> is one of the more leveraged tools as it helps the team see the flow, identify waste, and analyze data relevant to the organization. With that visual in place, teams can explore different areas using detailed <a href="https://asq.org/quality-resources/flowchart?ref=chatwithchin.com">Process Maps</a> to show sequential steps by function or <a href="https://asq.org/quality-resources/spaghetti-diagram?ref=chatwithchin.com">Spaghetti Diagrams </a>to visualize the movement of patients, staff, or materials. Data collection also plays a key role in this process and when combined with the use of methods like <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm?ref=chatwithchin.com">5 Whys</a> and Cause and Effect Diagrams (also known as <a href="https://asq.org/quality-resources/fishbone?ref=chatwithchin.com">Fishbone or Ishikawa diagrams</a>), teams can begin to understand the root cause of problems or identify waste.</p><p>Healthcare leaders are instrumental in ensuring resources are available to improve quality, access, satisfaction, and cost. With strategically focused improvement events, organizations can transform how care is delivered by working toward providing lower cost, better quality, and easy access for patients.</p><p>As with any change, improvement teams truly benefit when patients, caregivers, and those who perform the work feel empowered and are involved in the engagement. Improvement events can utilize <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001bJGwetpOB6YaDCdiOPDze8ZI0SOLc69jI2Gt4bW4FwxtNlttbystO1HVTI3cMuL1bwQ1Gd_vWl41w8r5oDOR7rXaPizMpzjqiq0dry9EB53ujmBlHa63NNALUT6zygeMq-ylRS9K96zgv7_F3XAUThPwXm4_4uca-JkoMHInOXg3Zh1NEaJjN9Xr2d3R-996zr7nVk1Aj30opTrmtDhLv3WJiLe1RifYVIy_X6oQIu4%3D&amp;c=gpdol0ZBYuncoHn4GeLXYIsuZWo_KeMxJKtcHtACM9EnSRyZPRFhvQ%3D%3D&amp;ch=Ilm32OfeJwdKEEeW8OyHtWa_P1323Gi9quDWERgIOiy_xdGtvr0CjQ%3D%3D&amp;ref=chatwithchin.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">A3 Thinking</a>, <a href="https://asq.org/quality-resources/pdca-cycle?ref=chatwithchin.com">PDCA/PDSA</a>, <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newSTR_97.htm?ref=chatwithchin.com">Kaizen</a>, or <a href="https://goleansixsigma.com/lean-six-sigma/?ref=chatwithchin.com">Lean/Six Sigma</a> methodology. While ultimately, patient satisfaction improves, so does employee satisfaction through efficiency and productivity gains.</p><p>To ensure that changes are sustained, project teams can create control plans along with standard work. The control plan and standard work provides clear information for teams to follow. In addition, teams should document lessons learned and celebrate their efforts to improve patient care.</p><p>Original post: <a href="https://www.renayejames.com/?ref=chatwithchin.com">Renaye James Healthcare Advisors</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 2, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://chatwithchin.com/authors/dr-chinue-uecker/" rel="author">Dr. Chinue Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://chatwithchin.com/from-hungar-to-housing-to-employment-in-rural-communities.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> From Hungar to Housing to Employment in Rural Communities</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chatwithchin.com/social-and-governance-justice-the-influence-and-role-of-strategy-and-strategists.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Social and Governance Justice – the Influence and Role of Strategy and Strategists </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://chatwithchin.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
